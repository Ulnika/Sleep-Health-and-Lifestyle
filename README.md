# Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis

This two-part data analysis project examines how lifestyle factors impact sleep health across different gender and occupational groups. The project was developed as part of the **DataTalent program from M2M Tech** using Python, pandas, and Bokeh for interactive visualization.

## Project Structure

### Part 1: Data Exploration & Preparation
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset
- Explored relationships between:
  - Sleep Duration
  - Sleep Quality
  - Stress Level
  - Physical Activity
  - Heart Rate and BMI
- Examined differences across **gender** and **occupational categories**

### Part 2: Interactive Visualization
- Built **interactive visualizations** using Bokeh:
  - Scatter plots with hover tools
  - Created a **widget interface** using `ipywidgets` to toggle views and update plots interactively.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Interactive widgets and Bokeh visualizations do not render in GitHub previews. To experience full interactivity, open the notebooks locally in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.

## Technologies Used

- Python: `pandas`, `numpy`, `ipywidgets`
- Visualization: `bokeh`, `matplotlib`
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights (based on presentation)

- Female participants tend to report **higher sleep quality** and **lower stress levels** across most occupations.
- **Occupational context** influences physical activity and stress.
- Heart rate and BMI show variation by gender and lifestyle, but may be influenced by other unmeasured variables.
